ðŸ§  Assumptions
	Duplicate emails are handled gracefully by using firstOrCreate logic.
	Contacts must belong to at least one list to be shown.
	CSV files must have full_name and email headers.
	UI and UX kept minimal to focus on Laravel logic and flow.

ðŸ“‚ Notes
	No email sending functionality is implemented.
	All contact-campaign associations are based on list linkage at the time of viewing the campaign.
	Trix editor is used for rich text messages in campaigns.
